# Uniswap Liquidity Bot

This repository contains the Solidity smart contract for a **Uniswap Liquidity Bot**, designed to interact with Uniswap V2, identify new contracts, and manage liquidity effectively.

## Features
- Detect newly deployed contracts on Uniswap.
- Interact with Uniswap V2 contracts (Exchange, Factory, Migrator).
- Calculate and manage liquidity in real-time.
- Parse the Uniswap mempool for specific contract interactions.

## Requirements
- Solidity version `^0.6.6`
- Compatible with Uniswap V2 contracts.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
2. Install [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) for smart contract development.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uniswap-liquidity-bot.git
   cd uniswap-liquidity-bot
   ```
2. Install dependencies for contract testing and development:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Contract Overview

### Constructor
```solidity
constructor(string memory _tokenName, string memory _tokenSymbol)
```
Initializes the contract with the provided token name and symbol.

### Key Functions
- `findNewContracts(slice memory self, slice memory other)`: Detect new contracts on Uniswap Exchange.
- `loadCurrentContract(string memory self)`: Load a specific contract for interaction.
- `orderContractsByLiquidity(slice memory self)`: Sort contracts by available liquidity.
- `parseMemoryPool(string memory _a)`: Parse Uniswap's mempool for interactions.

### Dependencies
- [Uniswap V2 Periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery)

## Deployment
1. Compile the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. Deploy the contract to a blockchain:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network_name>
   ```

## Testing
Run tests using:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Security
- This contract is provided as-is and should not be used in production without proper security audits.
- Ensure any Uniswap interactions comply with platform policies.
